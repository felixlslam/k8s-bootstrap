# k8s-bootstrap

## Introduction
We will setup a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 from scratch here. 

The purpose of this is to capture and try to automate, as much as possible, the process if we are to build the K8s from scratch elsewhere (on-premise or other cloud providers which do not provide K8s platform).
